# Pixel Perfect

A pixel perfect mockup made with React and Sass,  
based on this design:  https://www.figma.com/file/OqTPUFNMA2ecIStaTP7jMS/myteam?node-id=0%3A1.  
Alternatively, you can download the *myteam.sketch* file and view it in your preferred design tool.  

**My result:** https://eugee29.github.io/myteam/




- The appearence may vary depending on the tool you use to view the design file. Figma is the tool I used.
- Note that the page size in the design file is 1440px, so in order for my work to look like the reference, make sure to adjust your window size.
